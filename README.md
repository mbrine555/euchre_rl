# Learning to Play Euchre

This repository contains the Euchre Trick learning environment, created in [RLCard](https://github.com/datamllab/rlcard). 

## Euchre Trick

The environment is slightly simplified from regular Euchre. Each game consists of only one hand of Euchre, instead of repeatedly playing hands until a team reaches 10 points. It also does not include the option to go alone.
